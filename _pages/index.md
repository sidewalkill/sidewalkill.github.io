Hi, welcome to my website! I'm currently interning at [HaystaqDNA](https://haystaqdna.com/), a data analytics/political consulting company and plan to resume my studies at the [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu/) in the fall.

In my free time, I like to read, boulder/climb, <a href="https://www.geocaching.com/p/?u=sidewalkill">geocache</a> and play Avalon: The Resistance.

I was part of my high school's robotics team, [FRC Team 449](https://robot.mbhs.edu/) and I'm on my college's Quizbowl team (you can see my stats <a href="https://hdwhite.org/qb/stats/player/shwetha+kunnam/">here</a>).
